    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste </li>
        <li>3 anchovy fillets, chopped, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 (15 ounce) cans diced tomatoes, drained.</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped pitted kalamata olives</li>
        <li>¼ cup capers, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with water. Bring to a rolling boil over high heat.</li>
        <li>As the water heats, pour the olive oil into a cold skillet and stir in the garlic. Turn heat to medium-low and cook and stir until the garlic is fragrant and begins to turn a golden color, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the red pepper flakes, oregano, and anchovies. Cook until anchovies begin to break down, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour tomatoes into skillet, turn heat to medium-high, and bring sauce to a simmer. Use the back of a spoon to break down tomatoes as they cook. Simmer until sauce is reduced and combined, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook the pasta in the boiling water. Drain when still very firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup pasta water.</li>
        <li>Stir the olives and capers into the sauce; add pasta and toss to combine.</li>
        <li>Toss pasta in sauce until pasta is cooked through and well coated with sauce, about 1 minute. If sauce becomes too thick, stir in some of the reserved pasta water to thin.</li>
    </ol>
